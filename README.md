## Why this project?
My motivation for starting this project was initially from a drive to gain exposure to Flutter and Dart. As a Software Engineer, I pride myself on my code quality and ability to stay up to date in tech. Therefore, it was a natural step in my career to learn more about the mobile space—an increasingly important component of software development. 

While I wanted to build a simple, "low-pressure" application where I could sandbox and get used to the language and its features, I still wanted to build something would interest me. I decided on nutrition as the theme of the app, and built a rough UI. From here, I thoroughly came to enjoy the language and became inspired to implement good coding practices in the project— which is where I find myself now —currently improving on the quality of the application one step at a time.
